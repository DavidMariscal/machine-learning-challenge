Machine Learning Homework - Exoplanet Exploration


Background
Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.
To help process this data, you will create machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.
In this homework assignment, you will need to:

Preprocess the raw data
Tune the models
Compare two or more models


OBSERVATIONS: Random Forest is better than Support Vector Machine.
 GridSearchCV helped us to be more precise in certain modeling.
 Two generic approaches to sampling search candidates are provided in scikit-learn: for given values, GridSearchCV exhaustively considers all parameter combinations, while RandomizedSearchCV can sample a given number of candidates from a parameter space with a specified distribution.
